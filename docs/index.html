### Reminder of Using R and R Markdown Files

.pull-left[

- Download Zipped R project 

- Open Zipped folder and copy internal folder (R Project) to a BUA 345 folder on your computer NOT IN DOWLOADS

- **Open R Project:**
  
  - *OPTION 1:* Click on .Rproj file to open project and RStudio

  - *OPTION 2:* Open RStudio, then click File &gt; Open Project &gt; then navigate to  and click on .Rproj file.
  

- **Once Project is opened in RStudio:**

  - Click on `code_data_output` file to open it.

  - Click on `BUA_345_Lecture_23.Rmd` to open it.

  - Run `setup` Chunk

### Setup

.pull-left[

- The setup chunk shows the packages needed for this demo.   

- R will install specified packages if needed (only required once after R is installed)  

- R will load specified packaged (required every time you start a new R session)  

- The first time you run this code, R will install these packages which will be slow.  

- **If you get warnings, that's okay.**  

- If you get **error messages**, I (or TA), can help you.

### Setup Chunk for Lecture 23


```r
# this line specifies options for default options for all R Chunks
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=T, highlight=T)
# suppress scientific notation
options(scipen=100)

# install helper package that loads and installs other packages, if needed
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman", repos = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/")

# install and load required packages
pacman::p_load(pacman,tidyverse, magrittr, knitr, gridExtra, forecast, tidyquant, lubridate, maps, usdata, mapproj, ggthemes, RColorBrewer, dygraphs, climate)

# verify packages - it's a long list
#p_loaded()
```

**NOTES:**

- Please make sure you can open the provided R project for the practice questions and run the setup chunk without errors.
- If you are having trouble installing/loading any packages, please come to office hour or make an appointment with me or course TA.

### Plan for Today

- **Review of Time Series Concepts**

  - **Redemption for Syracuse!**
  
  - Review and New Terminology
  
- Review of Time Series without Seasonality

- Seasonality in Time Series Data

- Forecasting Trends with Seasonality in R

  - Example from HW 10: Alaska 
  - Data in HW 10 end in Q4 of 2021
  - Data in Lecture 23 end in Q4 of 2022
  
#### HW Assignment 10

  - **Today:** Questions 7 - 10

### Time Series Terminology

--

- **auto-correlation:** A variable is correlated with itself
  
- **auto-regression (AR):** Using previous observations to predict into the future.
  
- **R function:** **`auto.arima` - ARIMA** is an acronym:

  - **AR:** auto-regressive - `p` = number of lags to minimize auto-correlation
  
  - **I:** integrated - `d` = order of differencing to achieve stationarity
  
  - **MA:** moving average - `q` = number of terms in moving average   
  
  - All 3 components are optimized to provide a reliable forecast.
  
---

### More on Stationarity

- **Stationary Time Series:**
 
  - Consistent mean and variance throughout time series
  
  - Time series with trends, or with seasonality, are not stationary.
  
  - Separating a time series into different parts is how we analyze it
  
    - This is called **DECOMPOSITION**
    
    - Time Series Modeling decomposes the data into:
    
      - Trend
      
      - Seasonality (repeated pattern)
      
      - Residuals (what's left over)
    
---

### Decomposition and SARIMA Models

#### **NEW TERM: SARIMA model**

  - Lecture 22: **ARIMA** models
  
  - Today: ARIMA models with **SEASONAL** component.
  
  - **SARIMA:** **S**easonal **A**uto-**R**egressive **I**ntegrated **M**oving **A**verage.

--

- **SARIMA** models: 

  - optimize `p`, `d`, and `q` for whole time series 

  - Also optimize `p`, `d`, and `q` within season (repeating intervals)

--

#### **Decomposition**

- ARIMA models are decomposed into 

  - Trend | Residuals
  
- SARIMA models are decomposed into

  - Trend | Seasonal patterns | Residuals

---

### Visualization of Decomposition:

.pull-left[![](docs_files/images/decomp.png)]


.pull-right[

- **ARIMA:** 

 - 2nd Plot looks similar to Population Time Series
 
 - ARIMA decomposes trend into: 
 
     - Trend (2nd Plot)
     - Residuals (4th Plot)
     
- **SARIMA:** 

  - Plot 1: Time Series with a seasonal pattern.
  
  - SARIMA decomposes trend into: 
  
     - Trend (2nd Plot)
     - Seasonality (3rd Plot)
     - Residuals (4th Plot)

### Model Accuracy: 100 - MAPE = Model's Percent Accuracy


```r
(acr &lt;- accuracy(nflx_forecast))
```

--

- **For BUA 345:** We will use MAPE = Mean Absolute Percent Error

  - **100 – MAPE = Percent accuracy of model.**

- Despite increasing volatility, our stock price model is estimated to be 88.1% accurate.

- This doesn’t guarantee that forecasts will be 88% accurate but it does improve our chances of accurate forecasting.

#### Examining Residuals:

  - Top Plot: Spikes get larger over time 
  
  - ACF: auto-correlation function.
  
    - Ideally, all or most values are with dashed lines
    
  - Histogram: Distribution of residuals should be approx. normal
  
    - Appears okay
    
  - Assessment: Stock prices are very volatile and this is sufficient.

### Seasonal Data: Alaska Electricity Revenue

.pull-left[

**Alaska is very far north** so there is

- ***summer light*** (day and night)

- ***winter darkness*** (day and night)

Alaska Electricity usage has a **strong** seasonal pattern.

**Data range for Lecture 23**
- Start: 	First quarter of 2001
- End: 	  Last quarter of 2022 (HW 10 data end in 2021)

In addition to seasonality, we expect an upward trend in revenue due to:
- Increase in population
- Inflation of electricity prices

### Lecture 23 In-class Exercises - Session ID: bua345s23

#### Question 1 (L23) - Specifying a Time Series   

--

If our time series from Alaska were augmented so that it started in February of 1990 (2nd month) and we had data by month (12 observations per year), how would our ts command change in R?

Hint: Our current data, `ak_res` are quarterly, and begin in January of 2001. The command we used to create time series is:

**`ts(ak_res$Revenue, freq=4, start=c(2001,1))`**

&lt;br&gt;

A. `ts(ak_res$Revenue, freq=1, start=c(1, 1990))`

B. `ts(ak_res$Revenue, freq=4, start=c(2, 1990))`

C  `ts(ak_res$Revenue, freq=12, start=c(1990, 2))`

D.  `ts(ak_res$Revenue, freq=12, start=c(2, 1990))`

E.  `ts(ak_res$Revenue, freq=4, start=c(1, 1990))`

### **Alaska Residential Electricity Time Series**

#### **Incorrect Model: Ignores Seasonality (`seasonal = F`)**

- Notice how wide prediction intervals are.
- Model only optimizes `p`, `d`, and `q` for full time series `(0,1,0)`.


```r
ak_res_forecast1 &lt;- ak_res_ts |&gt; 
  auto.arima(ic="aic", seasonal=F) |&gt;
  forecast(h=4)
(autoplot(ak_res_forecast1) + labs(y = "AK Resid. Elec. Revenue") + theme_classic())
```

---

### **Alaska Residential Electricity Time Series**

#### **Correct Model: Includes Seasonality (`seasonal = T`)**

- Prediction intervals are **MUCH** more narrow
- Optimizes `p`, `d` and `q` for full time series `(1,0,0)` and within season `(0,1,1)`.
- Indicates number of time periods within season, `[4]`


```r
ak_res_forecast2 &lt;- ak_res_ts |&gt; 
  auto.arima(ic="aic", seasonal=T) |&gt;
  forecast(h=4)

### Lecture 23 In-class Exercises - Session ID: bua345s23

#### Question 2 (L23) - Requesting forecasts 

--

Our data is quarterly and has four observations per year ending in the 4th quarter of 2022.  

**If the state of Alaska wants to extend the forecast until the Fall of 2024 (3rd Quarter), how would they change the R command?**

Hint: Current forecast extends until the 4th quarter of 2023 and command is written as:

**`forecast(ak_res_model2, h=4)`**

--
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

A. `forecast(ak_res_model2, h=6)`

B. `forecast(ak_res_model2, h=7)`

C. `forecast(ak_res_model2, h=8)`

D. `forecast(ak_res_model2, h=9)`

- **Interpretation of 95% Prediction Bounds:**
--
  
- We are 95% certain that 4th qtr. revenue in 2023 will fall within:

  - Incorrect model range: **`$195.07 - $64.81 = $130`**
  - Correct model range:   **`$143.45 - $125.50 = $18`**

#### Comparison of Model Residuals
--

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="docs_files/figure-html/incorrect residuals-1.png" width="432" /&gt;

**Incorrect Model:**  
- Residuals **MUCH** larger
- Are highly correlated 
  - See ACF plot
- Residual plots indicate model is **INCORRECTLY** specified and invalid.

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="docs_files/figure-html/correct residuals-1.png" width="432" /&gt;

**Correct Model:**  
- Residuals **MUCH** smaller
- Auto-correlation assumption is met
  - ACF plot: lags in range
-  Residual plots indicate model is **CORRECTLY** specified and valid.

### Comparison of Model Accuracy

--

```r
(acr1 &lt;- accuracy(ak_res_forecast1))
```

```
##                     ME     RMSE      MAE        MPE    MAPE     MASE       ACF1
## Training set 0.7633924 16.52111 13.11085 -0.7495366 14.4931 2.960528 -0.0287675
```

- **The incorrect model's percent accuracy is 85.5%.**

- Better than expected.

--

```r
(acr2 &lt;- accuracy(ak_res_forecast2))
```

```
##                       ME     RMSE     MAE        MPE     MAPE      MASE
## Training set -0.02682329 3.641066 2.72117 -0.1430706 2.924482 0.6144606
##                     ACF1
## Training set -0.05698521
```

- **The correct model's percent accuracy is 97.1%.**

- Always plot data, but if seasonality is difficult to discern, run both models and compare them.

- Residuals (previous slide) and model accuracy (this slide) of models will indicate which model is correct.
