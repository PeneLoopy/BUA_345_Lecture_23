2021-2022 SNOW CHAMPS IN THE,,,,,
NY GOLDEN SNOWBALL SNOW CONTEST!!! ,,,,,
,,,,,
"St Patrick’s Day Weekend is here in Syracuse. Unfortunately only one of the few times I get to get out and enjoy Downtown Syracuse. A bunch of us every year, about 20 or more of us which is a mix of men and women normally hit a local soda pop bar early in the day. OK day meaning morning what can I say? Yes in the morning and don’t be coming to any conclusions. It’s only once a year we do this. Anyways family and friends come to town just for this day downtown. From Virginia, Poughkeepsie, Boston and so on. St Patty’s Day downtown is so much fun that people come from all over the country for it.",,,,,
"Congrats Buffalo, New York on unofficially winning the NY Golden Snowball virtual trophy ",,,,,
" Remember, the snow season goes on until the last second of July 30th. So nothing is official until The National Weather Service posts the final snow totals. Unless some really crazy weather happens (It Won’t) Buffalo will be the official winner. I’ll try and do an end-of-the-season summery in the next day or two.",,,,,
,,,,,
"All Buffalo, NY had to do this season was to be close to their yearly average at the end of the season to win, and they were. Buffalo was the only city out of the 5 to hit their normal season snow totals ",,,,,
,,,,,
"Most of the day pretty much consists of freezing our tails off but having a Super time in the process. The way we do St Patty’s day is pretty much just bar hop all day and test out all some of the different variety’s of brews that are on tap at the bars. I suppose you could say that we aren’t there so much as to have fun but let’s say we are doing research work on the brews. Maybe this year we will even take notes on our research. I do know that most of the men with us prefer the darker soda pops. Another good tip is to elect a leader to lead your group to the different bars. Someone who actually knows their way around the city of Syracuse. Remember, most of the time it is pretty cold out and for some reason almost always without fail the wind is blowing pretty good. The worse thing is to make a wrong turn and walk for a half a mile or so only to find out you have to go back the other way. For that my Brother in-law normally gets elected and does a fine job most of the time but every now and then he makes a wrong turn. That’s normally a good thing for who ever is the bad guy at the time enabling him to pass the title over to my brother in-law for getting us lost. Like I said the “bad guy or gal” gets passed along throughout the day and always has a ton of laughs to go along with it. Jeez, now that I am typing and keep seeing the word elected. I’m starting to see that St Patty’s Day is actually a fine example of the democracy in progress with all the elections we have going on. Most of the time the person being elected isn’t and to be frank doesn’t want to be elected",,,,,
"I would have felt calling it a week or so ago like some others did but the snow was still in the forecast and let’s face it, this snow season has been a crazy rollercoaster of temperatures and snow. The weather is still riding the rollercoaster it looks like but the temps should be a little too warm for much snow. JMO ",,,,,
"All in all we hit maybe 5 – 7 bars. We’ll normally order appetizers, wings or something at one of the bars early and then end up at Clarks sooner or later for one of their great roast beef sandwiches. If you go to Clarks don’t let the lines fool you. They rock at moving the customers along and you have your food in no time. The roast beef is well worth standing in line for. It’s truly awesome. I wish I could plug all the bars that we hit but to be honest with you I’m just a follower the whole day hoping I don’t get lost or left behind and never really check out the names of the bars we hit. I can only guess that any bar you end up in you’ll have a great time. One thing that bothered me a bit last year is that during the day a lot of the bars weren’t playing Irish songs. I don’t know what was up with that. To the bar owners Please at least play Irish music in the daytime.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Meanwhile, check out the Awesome graph below that Jim Kulak made for the contest and let us use it. It pretty much sums up the snow season for Buffalo, Rochester, Binghamton, Syracuse and Albany. Check it out!  Thanks, Jim, I appreciate it ",,,,,
,,,,,
The day downtown or sometimes night downtown (depending on how much research some of us have done) will end with one of us calling our designated drivers to come pick us up. We use to try and catch or call a couple of taxis to get home but that is another story or two in itself. The last time we called for two taxis only one showed up. Being the gentlemen that we are (yes only gentlemen in our group ) we told the ladies to go ahead and we would suffer and wait it out until the next taxi shows up. Well what are the chances of not one of us having a watch on and you all know how time flies. Before we knew it almost a couple of hours went by. Anyways I’m sure you already figured out that the ladies weren’t too happy with the men. Something to this day I haven’t figured out because we all thought the women would of been impressed with how patient we were waiting for the taxi to arrive. Everyone knows men aren’t known to be patient and so what if our patience was being displayed at a hopping bar. That shouldn’t even come in to the picture should it That was the end to taxi’s being used for the ride back to town.,,,,,
,,,,,
Summary Finally – Sorry about the rant. I really could of kept going on. To sum it up I always thought St Patrick’s day was a great big party downtown. After typing this up I discovered it’s actually a democracy process in the works with all the electing we do in our group along with research work. Research on the different brews of beer downtown. The research work by far is the hardest part of the day. Now knowing that it’s not the Big Party that I always thought it was I probably won’t be able to enjoy it like I have in the past. I’ll give it my best shot though,,,,,

Welcome back to another exciting game of which city will be the snowiest this season in the Golden Snowball snow contest. Buffalo and Binghamton opened up the 2019-2020 snow season around November 7th. Albany and Binghamton have started the new 2020-2021 snow season.,,,,,
,,,,,
Rochester is the defending champ this season winning both the New York Golden Snowball contest and the national Golden Snow Globe snow contest for Big cities in the United States.,,,,,
,,,,,
"Although last season was pretty exciting, none of the cities hit the normal snowfall for the season. It will be fun to see how it goes for the 2020-2021 snow season.",,,,,

CONGRATS Rochester and Well Deserved! Rochester is the winner of the 2019-2020 Golden Snowball award. The last time Rochester won it was back during the 2011-2012 snow season. Buffalo was the defending champ this season.,,,,,
,,,,,
Buffalo and Binghamton opened up the 2019-2020 snow season with 0.6 inches around November 7th. Syracuse took the lead around Nov. 8th with a total of 2.2 inches.,,,,,
,,,,,
Rochester took over the lead on Nov. 11th having 3.2 inches on the season. On Nov. 12th all of the cities had snow now and Buffalo took the lead with a new total of 12.4 inches. Rochester moved into the lead again on Nov. 13th with 17.3 inches.,,,,,
,,,,,
"We went into December with Rochester having the lead over Buffalo by about half a foot of snow. Around Dec. 3rd Albany took the lead. Really, but it didn’t last long ",,,,,
" Rochester took the lead back around Dec. 5th and never looked back. It looked like the snow contest was off to a good start and that it was going to be a fun snow season ahead, and it was IMO 😉",,,,,
,,,,,
Going into January 2020 it was:,,,,,
,,,,,
Rochester,,,,,
Albany,,,,,
Syracuse,,,,,
Buffalo,,,,,
Binghamton,,,,,
,,,,,
"On around Dec. 6th or 7th, Syracuse moved into second place and Albany was in their normal spot, last place 😉",,,,,
,,,,,
"Rochester went into February leading second-place Syracuse by about 15 inches of snow. The closest Syracuse could get to Rochester the rest of the snow season was a little over 3 inches behind. Rochester held strong throughout the snow season and was the king of the snow hill for most of it. Barring any unforeseen, crazy weather, Rochester is and deserves to be the King of the Golden Snowball Snow Mountain. Congrats Rochester on unofficially wing the snow contest for the 2019-2020 snow season. Well deserved and it turns official on July 1st when the next season starts ",,,,,

Four Cities Start Off The 2019-2020 Snow Contest,,,,,
,,,,,
"Buffalo, Binghamton, Rochester, and Syracuse are all reporting their first measurable snow for the new 2019-2020 snow season. This season is starting up a little later than the 2018-2019 snow season did. Last season the Golden Snowball snow contest started on or around October 22nd. Buffalo is the defending Champ this season out snowing all of the other cities with 118.8 inches of snow last season. Buffalo also won the National Golden Snow Globe snow contest for big cities in the United States. It should be a fun, longgggg snow season ahead ",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
"Buffalo is tied with Binghamton right now followed by Rochester and Syracuse. Albany hasn’t reported any snow yet today. I’m guessing that the snow totals will change by tomorrow’s update. Syracuse is the favorite at the start of each season normally followed by Rochester, then Buffalo, then Binghamton and I suppose Albany. Albany is the only city that has never won the Golden Snowball snow contest and I don’t see that changing in my lifetime. Just think out loud 😛",,,,,
,,,,,
More Snow Next Week Maybe,,,,,
,,,,,
"I’m starting to hear some rumors about maybe some decent snow come early next week. I haven’t had a chance to read up on it yet and to be honest, it’s a little too early right now but it could be something to keep an eye on. So, the snow season is just beginning and it should be a lot of fun. It always is and all of you that visit the site and respond make it fun.",,,,,
,,,,,
"We have a FaceBook page that is pretty active during the winter months and you should check it out and join. It’s a great mix of people of all ages, both men and women, snow lovers and snow haters. You can join the snow group which is for both the New York snow contest and the National snow contest here at",,,,,

 Current standings here!,,,,,
,,,,,
"It’s a little earlier than last season when Buffalo started up the snow season and the Golden Snowball snow contest. Last season Buffalo started up the New York snow contest on or around 10/31, Halloween, with a tenth of an inch of snow.",,,,,
,,,,,
I’ve been reading different winter forecasts as to how this winter will shape up and I’ll have the Golden Snowball winter outlook posted sometime soon. You won’t want to miss it. Nevermind NOAA’s and the Farmers Almanac 😉 Stay tuned and have a fun safe snowy season all 😉,,,,,
